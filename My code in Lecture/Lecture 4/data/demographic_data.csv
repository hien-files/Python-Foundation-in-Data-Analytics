Good morning Ms. Huong

I hope this message finds you well. I am Tam a Data Analyst at VNPAY and we have been in touch via LinkedIn since a few months ago. Currently, I am planning to look for an opportunity at ZaloPay because after carefully researching, I find myself a good fit for the company's dynamic culture and sharing the joy of working with data analysis, turning analyzed information into insight, and building machine learning algorithms to solve business questions, so I am excited to write this message to apply for the Data Analyst position in your company.

Working with data and machine learning algorithms is so enjoyable to me because it gives me chances to utilize my proactive problem-solving skills and efficient research abilities to create value for the team. I also have completed several Power BI reports, analyzed fintech customer behavior, accomplished Microsoft's PL-300 for Data Analyst Certification, and some Machine learning and Deep learning projects,... which built me a strong of knowledge in manipulating data, statistical modeling, and machine learning techniques. So now, I am seeking an opportunity to work in a professional, continuously learning environment where I can expose my potential to support the growth of the company.

I have attached my certifications and resume as a brief summary of my experiences, projects, and education. I am looking forward to discussing with you more about this opportunity and how I can contribute to the team.

Thank you for your consideration!

Best Regards,
Trần Thành Tâm - Data Analyst
